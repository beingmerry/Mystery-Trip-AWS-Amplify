# AWS Goals

## Deploy!

"I would really like to deploy the web site first, then build." - Ben Merryman on the first day of the project

# Vite Goals

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a much more modern, typed version of JavaScript. I should be able to learn it quickly enough!

## Vite Reasoning

- Zero Vulnerabilities at install!
- Very similar to standard React libraries
- Lets make sure this is as complicated as possible.
